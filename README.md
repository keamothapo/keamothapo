# 👋 Hey there, fellow netizen!

I'm **Keabetswe Mothapo** — a digital explorer at the crossroads of **Computer Science** and **Law**. Currently charting my course through a BSc in Information and Knowledge Systems, merging code with clauses (yes, I did computer science and law — don't ask. I just love both!).

## 🕵️‍♀️ About Me

Venturing into the complex maze of cyber governance, ethics, and compliance; I'm passionate about the niche realms of applying law to **cybersecurity** and **cyber forensics**. I thrive where bytes meet briefs, navigating the intricate labyrinth of digital legality.

## 🎯 Fun Fact

When I'm not dissecting code or legal statutes, you'll find me doing one of three things:
  1. pondering the ethical implications of AI over a tub of ice-cream
  2. sleeping (I don't do caffeine, so naps are the next best alternative)
  3. the most likely option: weaving through the internet for true crime tales!

  N.B: you should have seen that last one coming. I cannot be interested in cyber law without being a true crime junkie - otherwise, I would be a fraud🤷
